# Clone-of-The-game-of-life

Hi this is my first repository in GitHub, this is just a clone of "The game of life" , just to test my knowledge 
on python 

# What is this?
This is "a game" or "a simulation" ,depends of your point of view, what simulates the life of single entity with other entites
with some rules of the state of the entity , like dead or alive (0 and 1), to simulate the life of a comunnity of that entites

# 1. The rules to live and die

There are 2 global rules in this simulation

1. If a dead entity is surrounded by  3 entites that entity resurrect
2. If a entity is surroubded by less than 2 entites or more than 3 , that entity dies (isolation and over population)
